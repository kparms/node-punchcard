# Punchcard!

an ebcdic encoder/decoder, an ibm-style punchcard hole number encoder, and a formatter to print lulzy ascii cards. Well, kinda lulzy.

## See?

```
% node hiworld.js 
hello world! on a punchcard: 
.____________
|987654321ABC\
| ▘       ▘ ▘ |

## So does it actually work yet?

Based on spot checking, it certainly seems to! That said, there's no decoder yet, and that would really be the proof I'd think.
