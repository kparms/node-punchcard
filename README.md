# Punchcard!

an ebcdic encoder/decoder, an ibm-style punchcard hole number encoder, and a formatter to print lulzy ascii cards. Well, kinda lulzy.

## See?

```
% node hiworld.js 
hello world! on a punchcard: 
.____________

```

## So does it actually work yet?

I don't know yet! I'll need to write a decoder first!
